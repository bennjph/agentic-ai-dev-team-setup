## How to Contribute

### 1. Report Issues

Found a bug or have a feature request?

**Open an issue** with:
- Clear description
- Steps to reproduce (if bug)
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Your tier (solo / team / enterprise)

---

### 2. Suggest Improvements

Have an idea for a better workflow?

**Open a discussion** or issue with:
- Problem you're solving
- Proposed solution
- Trade-offs
- Which tier it applies to

---

### 3. Submit Changes

**Process**:
1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch (`feature/your-idea`)
3. Make changes
4. Test with your team (if possible)
5. Submit PR with:
   - Clear description of change
   - Why it's better
   - Which tier(s) it affects
   - Before/after examples (if applicable)

---

## What We're Looking For

**Welcome**:
- ✅ Bug fixes (typos, broken links, incorrect instructions)
- ✅ Clarity improvements (better explanations, examples)
- ✅ New examples (more code snippets, use cases)
- ✅ Tier-specific enhancements (e.g., Enterprise runbook integration)

**Need discussion first**:
- 🟡 New commands (may add complexity)
- 🟡 Changing tier definitions (affects many users)
- 🟡 Major workflow changes (need consensus)

**Not accepted**:
- ❌ Tool-specific features (must stay model-agnostic)
- ❌ Vendor lock-in (e.g., "Use X cloud service")
- ❌ Complexity without clear benefit

## Style Guide

### Documentation

- **Clear**: Write for beginners
- **Concise**: No fluff
- **Examples**: Show code, not just concepts
- **Formatting**: Use headings, bullets, code blocks

### Code Examples

- **Language-agnostic** where possible
- **Real-world** (not toy examples)
- **Commented** (explain non-obvious parts)

---

## Testing Changes

**Before submitting PR**:
1. Test command with your AI tool (OpenCode, Cursor, etc.)
2. Verify artifact is created correctly
3. Check that examples work
4. Update relevant docs (README, WORKFLOW, etc.)

---

## Review Process

**Timeline**: We aim to review within 7 days.

**What we check**:
- Does it improve the template?
- Is it model-agnostic?
- Does it work across tiers?
- Is documentation clear?

**Feedback**: We'll comment on PR with requested changes.
